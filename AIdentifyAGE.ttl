Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given.

Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria.

For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition.
